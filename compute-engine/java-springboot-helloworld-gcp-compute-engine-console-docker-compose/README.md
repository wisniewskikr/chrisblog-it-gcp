USAGE
-----

> **NOTE** This usage assumes that user possesses **Google Account** with existing **GCP Project**. It also assumes that **Docker Image** of **Java Spring Boot** application is deployed on public repository in **Docker Hub**. 

Steps:
1. Create GCP Compute Engine. Please check section **CREATE GCP COMPUTE ENGINE**
1. Deploy application via SSH. Please check section **DEPLOY APPLICATION VIA SSH**
     * Update Linux version with `sudo apt update`
     * Install Docker with `sudo apt install docker.io`
     * Install Docker Compose with `sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
     * Permit Docker Compose with `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
     * Install Git with `sudo apt install -y git`
     * Clone application with `sudo git clone https://github.com/wisniewskikr/chrisblog-it-gcp.git`
     * Start application with `sudo docker-compose -f chrisblog-it-gcp/compute-engine/java-springboot-helloworld-gcp-compute-engine-console-docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d`
     * Visit application with `http://{PUBLIC-IP}:8080`
1. Delete GCP Compute Engine. Please check section **DELETE GCP COMPUTE ENGINE**


DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to present how to deploy **Java Spring Boot** application on **GCP Compute Engine** using **GCP Console**. Tool **Docker Compose** is used for the deployment.

##### Terminology
Terminology explanation:
* **GCP**: it means Google Cloud Platform (GCP). There are compute services provided by Google via Internet
* **GCP Compute Engine**: it's GCP service which provides Virtual Machine. User can install there any tool or application
* **GCP Console**: it's web application which enables working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) via internet's browser
* **Java Spring Boot application**: it's application in Java programming language which uses Spring Boot framework. This application displays "Hello World" message, port and uuid in JSON format

##### Flow
The following flow takes place in this project:
1. User creates GCP Compute Engine
1. User deploys application via SSH - installs Docker tool and starts application
1. User opens deployed application URL in browser
1. User via any browser sends request to application for a content
1. Application HelloWorld returns response with JSON containing message, port and UUID. This response is presented to User via browser
1. User cleans up

##### Launch
To launch this application please make sure that the **Preconditions** are met and then follow instructions from **Usage** section.
